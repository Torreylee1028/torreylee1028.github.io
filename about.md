description: “Uncovering the unknown through data is like taking a photo in pitch black. Setting tweaks through long camera exposures and focusing in the dark on the unknown, the insights and layers start to shine through, presenting themselves, exposing the stars, the landscape, the features, and facts that were hidden before you.” - Me

					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Working for a large theme park, I have integrated, developed, and maintained a variety of PowerBI dashboards for many departments, bringing insights on financials and workload labor. By providing these dashboards, senior leaders have the power to dive in to their data and uncover insights they did not have access to before. </p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Although I am an analytical thinker, my creativity thrives through my love for photography, crafting, sewing, and quilting. I have a passion for traveling, with the goal to visit all 62 U.S. National Parks. I have visited over 50% of them, my favorite being Glacier National Park in Montana. Along with my passion for photography, the photos on my portfolio site are taken from my travels. </p>
