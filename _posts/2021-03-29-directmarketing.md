# Direct Marketing

## Predictive Analytics

### Summary
This project was a collaborative effort between two other teammates. The project’s goal was to predict what type of spender a potential customer would be based on household characteristics. The spending types were low, medium, and high. We implemented five different types of models and compared them to see which yield the highest accuracy score.

### Modeling Methods
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest

### Results
Our results led to the random forest having the highest accuracy score overall. However, we concluded that further data would need to be gathered if a company were to implement this model with the variables given.
