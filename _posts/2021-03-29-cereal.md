## Clustering - Data Mining

### Summary
This project was my first attempt at utilizing different clustering techniques on different cereal products. Similar breakfast cereals were clustered based on nutrition facts. Part of this project was determining the best method to cluster based on the distribution of the data. Not all methods should be used and will produce different results. This project looks at the different methods and why K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering were the ones that the project focused on.


### Modeling Methods & Evaluation Metrics
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
* Density clustering with DBSCAN
* Expectation-Maximization
* Dimensionality reduction with PCA
* Elbow test
* Silhouette score

### Results
The cereal was grouped into 6 clusters based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
