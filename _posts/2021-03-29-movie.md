## Exploratory Data analysis

### Summary
The success of movies project was my first data science project where I applied one component of the data science process, statistical analysis. This analysis was also conducted entirely in the R programming language. This project allowed me create graphs in R and learn how to interpret those statistical graphs. I also attempted my first linear and multiple regression models to see if I could predict the success of a movie by predicting its profit.

### Highlights
* Filtering data in R
* Summary statistics
* Scatter plots
* Q-Q plots
* Correlation
* Regression

### Project Preview
```
ggplot(moviesdf, aes(x = budget, y = profit)) + geom_point(position = "jitter", color = "dark blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Budget", y = "Profit", title = "Movies: Budget vs Profit")
```
